Hit the Doom was born from the need for the user to have their first experience with the electronic drums, available on PC and mobile.  On the website you can interact with the battery,  the system in which you are working allows each key that is pressed corresponds to an original sound of the product.

The project is in process, the structure and functionality of the mobile is already in the unclose phase of development. In the next few days we will start adapting the code for desktop.
Check the progress.
